    <p>This spicy chicken is great either as a standalone nibble, or as the meatbase of another dish</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Toss chicken pieces lightly in chili oil. Mix garlic powder, chili powder, and salt together well in a bowl. Coat chicken with spice mixture; place coated chicken pieces on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken bites in the preheated oven until browned, chicken is no longer pink at the center, and juices run clear, about 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
