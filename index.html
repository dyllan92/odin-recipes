    <p>Lasagna is a dish comprised of meat, cheese, and lasagna sheets. Although like most pasta dishes it originates from Italy, many countries and cultures worldwide have put their own spin on the dish</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>2 Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 cans Crushed Tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cans Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>2 cans Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>Parsley, Basil, Salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper</li>
        <li>Lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>Parmesan, Mozzarella, and Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
